In Flutter, there isn't a specific command to generate service classes like there is in Angular with its CLI. In Flutter, you would typically manually create the files for your services. To create a service, you simply add a new Dart file in the appropriate directory within your `lib` folder.

Regarding the naming convention for services in Flutter, it generally follows the Dart file naming conventions, which are:

- File names should be in lowercase and, if necessary for clarity, words are separated by underscores (snake_case).
- Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.

For services, a common practice is to end the file and class names with `Service` to clearly indicate their purpose. For instance, if you have a service for handling user authentication, you might name the file `auth_service.dart` and the class within it `AuthService`.

So, in your case, you might create a file named `shuffle_service.dart` in your `services` directory with the `ShuffleService` class inside it. This keeps your code organized and makes the purpose of the file clear.

Given your requirements, the Dart `Random` class should suffice for creating deterministic random numbers given the same seed. Dart's `Random` accepts an integer seed and will produce the same sequence of random numbers for the same seed, which aligns with your need for determinism.

The `hashCode` function is no longer necessary since we can directly use the seed as an integer. Here's the adapted Dart service:

```dart
import 'dart:math';

class ShuffleService {
  late Random _random;

  void seed(int seed) {
    _random = Random(seed);
  }

  List<T> shuffle<T>(List<T> array) {
    // Creates a copy of the array to avoid modifying the original array
    List<T> shuffledArray = List<T>.from(array);

    for (int i = shuffledArray.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
      int n = _random.nextInt(i + 1);
      T temp = shuffledArray[i];
      shuffledArray[i] = shuffledArray[n];
      shuffledArray[n] = temp;
    }

    return shuffledArray;
  }
}
```

In this service:

- The `seed` method initializes the `_random` variable with a new `Random` instance seeded with the given integer.
- The `shuffle` method implements the Fisher-Yates (or Knuth) shuffle algorithm to shuffle the array. It modifies a copy of the input array to avoid side effects.

To use this service in your Flutter application, you would first seed the random number generator with a specific integer, and then call `shuffle` with the array you wish to shuffle. The same seed will always produce the same sequence of shuffled arrays.
