To translate your Angular routes to Flutter and add a side menu (drawer), you'll need to:

1. Define the routes in Flutter.
2. Create a drawer for navigation.
3. Set up navigation to different screens based on the routes.

Since Flutter doesn't use lazy-loaded modules like Angular, your route setup will be more straightforward. You'll directly map routes to widgets (pages) in Flutter.

Here's how you can set up your Flutter app:

### Step 1: Define Flutter Screens

First, create Dart files for each of your pages (e.g., `home_page.dart`, `setup_page.dart`, etc.) and define a StatelessWidget for each page. For example:

```dart
// In home_page.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home'),
      ),
      // Your page content
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Set Up Routes in MaterialApp

In your `main.dart` or main app widget, define the routes:

```dart
// In main.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'home_page.dart'; // import all your pages
import 'setup_page.dart';
import 'solitaire_page.dart';
import 'image_credits_page.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Your App Title',
      initialRoute: '/home',
      routes: {
        '/home': (context) => HomePage(),
        '/setup': (context) => SetupPage(),
        '/solitaire': (context) => SolitairePage(),
        '/image-credits': (context) => ImageCreditsPage(),
      },
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Add a Drawer for Navigation

In your main app widget or a base layout widget, add a `Drawer` widget to create a side menu:

```dart
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Home'),
      ),
      drawer: Drawer(
        child: ListView(
          padding: EdgeInsets.zero,
          children: <Widget>[
            DrawerHeader(
              child: Text('Menu'),
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
            ),
            ListTile(
              title: Text('Home'),
              onTap: () {
                Navigator.pop(context); // Close the drawer
                Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, '/home');
              },
            ),
            ListTile(
              title: Text('Setup'),
              onTap: () {
                Navigator.pop(context);
                Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, '/setup');
              },
            ),
            // Add other ListTile widgets for each route
          ],
        ),
      ),
      // Your page content
    );
  }
}
```

In this setup:

- `Drawer` provides a side menu accessible via a hamburger icon.
- `ListView` with `ListTile` widgets allows navigation to different pages.
- `Navigator.pushReplacementNamed` is used for navigation, replacing the current route.

Here are the `touch` commands to create each of these files in your Flutter project. Make sure you are in the root directory of your Flutter project when you run these commands:

1. **Home Page File**:

   ```bash
   touch lib/home_page.dart
   ```

2. **Setup Page File**:

   ```bash
   touch lib/setup_page.dart
   ```

3. **Solitaire Page File**:

   ```bash
   touch lib/solitaire_page.dart
   ```

4. **Image Credits Page File**:

   ```bash
   touch lib/image_credits_page.dart
   ```

5. **Main App File**:
   This file (`main.dart`) usually already exists in a new Flutter project, but if you need to create it:
   ```bash
   touch lib/main.dart
   ```

After running these commands, you'll have all the necessary Dart files in your `lib` directory to start implementing the screens and main app structure as described. Remember to fill each file with the appropriate Dart code for each screen and the main app widget.

With the routes and empty pages scaffolded as described, basic navigation in your Flutter app should work, provided that:

1. Each of the page files (`home_page.dart`, `setup_page.dart`, `solitaire_page.dart`, `image_credits_page.dart`) contains the necessary Dart code for a minimal Flutter screen. At the very least, each screen should return a `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` and some content (even if it's just a `Text` widget) to ensure that the pages are valid and can be rendered.

2. The routes are correctly defined in your main app widget (`main.dart`) within the `MaterialApp` widget's `routes` parameter.

3. The `Drawer` in the `HomePage` (or any base page you're using) is correctly set up for navigation, with `ListTile`s that use `Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, '/routeName')` to navigate to the different routes.

Assuming these conditions are met, tapping on the menu items in the drawer should navigate you to the respective pages. Remember that this setup provides a basic navigation framework. Depending on your app's requirements, you might need to add more features or logic, such as handling back navigation, passing data between screens, or managing deep links.

If you encounter any issues or the navigation doesn't work as expected, you may need to check the console for any error messages, which can provide insights into what might be going wrong.

## Global Menu Bar

To make the menu available on all pages in your Flutter app, you have two primary approaches:

### Approach 1: Use a Base Widget

Create a base widget that includes the `Scaffold` and `Drawer`, and then use this base widget on all your pages. This way, each page will have its own AppBar and Drawer.

### Approach 2: Modify the Navigation Logic

Instead of navigating to a completely new screen with `Navigator.pushReplacementNamed`, you could modify the navigation logic to only change the body of the `Scaffold` while keeping the AppBar and Drawer intact. This could be more complex, as it requires a more dynamic approach to manage which widget is displayed in the body of the Scaffold.

This approach is more involved and might require a state management solution to keep track of the current screen and update the body of the Scaffold accordingly.

---

Both approaches will ensure that the drawer menu is accessible from all pages. The first approach is simpler and more straightforward but might lead to some redundancy. The second approach is more complex but can offer a smoother user experience, as the AppBar and Drawer won't be rebuilt on navigation. The choice depends on your specific requirements and the complexity of your application.

In the case of this simple app, let's investigate the first approach.

---

For a simple app, using the first approach with a base widget is a great choice. It simplifies the implementation and maintains consistency across different screens. Here's a step-by-step guide to implement this approach:

### Step 1: Create the Base Widget

Create a new Dart file for the base widget. You might name it `base_page.dart`. This widget will include the common `Scaffold` and `Drawer` structure that will be used by all pages.

**base_page.dart**:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class BasePage extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget child;
  final String title;

  BasePage({required this.child, required this.title});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text(title)),
      drawer: Drawer(
        child: ListView(
          padding: EdgeInsets.zero,
          children: <Widget>[
            DrawerHeader(
              child: Text('Menu'),
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
            ),
            ListTile(
              title: Text('Home'),
              onTap: () {
                Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, '/home');
              },
            ),
            ListTile(
              title: Text('Setup'),
              onTap: () {
                Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, '/setup');
              },
            ),
            // ... other ListTiles for navigation
          ],
        ),
      ),
      body: child,
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Update Each Page to Use BasePage

Now, update each of your pages to use `BasePage`. For example, in your `home_page.dart`, you would wrap the content of your home page in `BasePage`.

**home_page.dart**:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'base_page.dart'; // Import BasePage

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BasePage(
      title: 'Home',
      child: Center(
        child: Text('Home Page Content'), // Your home page content
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Repeat this pattern for each of your other pages (`setup_page.dart`, `solitaire_page.dart`, `image_credits_page.dart`), replacing the inner content with the specific content for each page.

### Step 3: Test the Navigation

Run your app and test the navigation. Each page should now display the same AppBar and Drawer, and you should be able to navigate between pages using the Drawer.

This approach ensures that the menu is consistently available across all screens and simplifies the management of common elements like the AppBar and Drawer. Since each page uses the `BasePage` widget, any changes you make to the `BasePage` (like adding new items to the Drawer) will automatically reflect across all screens that use it.

## Identify Current Page

To disable or indicate the current page in the base page menu, you can use a combination of state management and conditional styling or disabling of the `ListTile` widgets in the drawer. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

### Step 1: Update `BasePage` to Accept the Current Route

First, modify the `BasePage` class to accept a parameter that indicates the current route. This parameter will be used to determine which menu item should be disabled or styled differently.

**base_page.dart**:

```dart
class BasePage extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget child;
  final String title;
  final String currentRoute;

  BasePage({required this.child, required this.title, required this.currentRoute});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text(title)),
      drawer: Drawer(
        child: ListView(
          padding: EdgeInsets.zero,
          children: <Widget>[
            DrawerHeader(
              child: Text('Menu'),
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
            ),
            _buildDrawerItem(
              context: context,
              title: 'Home',
              route: '/home',
              currentRoute: currentRoute,
            ),
            _buildDrawerItem(
              context: context,
              title: 'Setup',
              route: '/setup',
              currentRoute: currentRoute,
            ),
            // ... other _buildDrawerItem calls for navigation
          ],
        ),
      ),
      body: child,
    );
  }

  Widget _buildDrawerItem({
    required BuildContext context,
    required String title,
    required String route,
    required String currentRoute,
  }) {
    bool isCurrentPage = route == currentRoute;

    return ListTile(
      title: Text(
        title,
        style: isCurrentPage ? TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold) : null,
      ),
      onTap: isCurrentPage ? null : () {
        Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, route);
      },
    );
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Pass the Current Route When Using `BasePage`

In each of your page widgets, pass the current route name to the `BasePage`.

**home_page.dart**:

```dart
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BasePage(
      title: 'Home',
      currentRoute: '/home',
      child: Center(
        child: Text('Home Page Content'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Do this for each of your pages, replacing `'/home'` with the respective route for each page.

### Step 3: Test the Updated Navigation

Run your app and open the drawer on different pages. The menu item for the current page should now be styled differently or disabled, indicating that it's the current page.

This approach uses a simple form of state management by passing the current route to the `BasePage`. The `_buildDrawerItem` method then determines whether the menu item corresponds to the current route and adjusts its behavior and style accordingly. This method provides a clear visual cue to the user about which page they are currently viewing.
