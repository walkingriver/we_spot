In Flutter, the concept of playing audio is handled differently than in web technologies like HTML and JavaScript. Instead of using `HTMLAudioElement`, Flutter relies on packages to play audio. A popular choice for this is the `audioplayers` package.

To create an equivalent structure for `GameSound` in Flutter, you would typically define a class to manage sound-related data and operations. However, instead of storing an `HTMLAudioElement`, you would manage audio playback through methods provided by the audio package you choose.

Here's a suggested Dart class structure that resembles your `GameSound` interface, using the `audioplayers` package:

1. Add the `audioplayers` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     audioplayers: ^0.20.1 # Use the latest version available
   ```

2. Create a class `GameSound` in Dart:

   File: `game_sound.dart`

   ```dart
   import 'package:audioplayers/audioplayers.dart';

   class GameSound {
     final String name;
     final AudioPlayer audioPlayer = AudioPlayer();

     GameSound({required this.name});

     Future<void> play() async {
       await audioPlayer.play(AssetSource('$name.mp3'));
     }

     void stop() {
       audioPlayer.stop();
     }
   }
   ```

In this class:

- `name` is a string that could represent the filename of the audio file.
- `audioPlayer` is an instance of `AudioPlayer` from the `audioplayers` package.
- The `play` method plays the audio file whose name matches the `name` property. This example assumes audio files are stored as assets in your project.
- The `stop` method stops the audio playback.

This setup requires you to have your audio files in the assets directory of your Flutter project and listed in your `pubspec.yaml` under the assets section. Adjust the `play` method's `AssetSource` path according to your project's structure.
