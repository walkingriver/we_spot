To create a new Flutter app using the command line on your Mac, you can use the following command in your terminal (bash):

```bash
flutter create my_app
```

Replace `my_app` with your desired project name. This command will scaffold a new Flutter project with all the necessary directories and files in a folder named after your project.

Once the command completes, you can open this project in Visual Studio Code and start working on it. Remember to navigate into your project directory before opening it in VS Code:

```bash
cd my_app
code .
```

The `code .` command opens the current directory (`my_app`) in Visual Studio Code.

Yes, in a Flutter application, it's common to place service files under the `lib` directory, often in a dedicated folder to maintain organization and clarity. You might structure it like this:

```
lib/
    services/
        your_service.dart
        another_service.dart
    // other directories like models, views, widgets, etc.
```

In this structure, each service is a Dart file within the `services` folder. This mirrors a typical Angular project's organization, where services are kept in their own folder for modularity and maintainability.

When you convert your Angular services to Dart, remember that Angular services often include dependency injection, HTTP requests, and state management, which are handled differently in Flutter. You'll need to adapt these aspects to Dart and Flutter's ecosystem, possibly using packages like `provider` for state management or `http` for HTTP requests.
